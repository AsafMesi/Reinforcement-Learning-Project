# Reinforcement Learning Project

**By: Asaf Mesilaty**

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Project! This project explores various RL algorithms using the MiniGrid environment. Below you will find detailed instructions on how to set up and use the project files effectively.

## Accessing the Project Files

All relevant files for this project are stored in a Google Drive directory. You can access them through the following link:

[Google Drive Project Directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rJMNpSs9oALlV29Vbq9EbTcd803uCc1y?usp=sharing)

In this directory, you will find five Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a different Reinforcement Learning algorithm, and related utility files necessary to run these notebooks.

## Project Notebooks

The project consists of the following notebooks:

1. TabularQLearning.ipynb
2. EmptyDQN.ipynb
3. EmptyActorCritic.ipynb
4. EmptyPPO.ipynb
5. KeyDQN.ipynb

Each notebook is designed to guide you step-by-step through the process of implementing a specific RL algorithm to solve problems using the MiniGrid environment.

## Required Files (minigrid_x.py)

To run these notebooks, you will need to include a specific Python file (`minigrid_x.py`) in your temporary disk. There are two versions of this file, each in a different directory:

- **For TabularQLearning.ipynb**:
  - Use the `minigrid_x.py` located in the "Minigrid file for Tabular" directory.

- **For EmptyDQN.ipynb, EmptyActorCritic.ipynb, EmptyPPO.ipynb, KeyDQN.ipynb**:
  - Use the `minigrid_x.py` located in the "Minigrid file for Deep RL" directory.

## Setup Instructions

To set up your environment to run these notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Required `minigrid_x.py` File**:
   - Navigate to the respective directory in the Google Drive based on the notebook you wish to run.
   - Download the `minigrid_x.py` file.

2. **Upload the File to Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter notebook (one of the five listed above) that you want to work on.
   - Drag the downloaded `minigrid_x.py` file to the Files tab in your Jupyter notebook environment to upload it.

## Reading the Project Report

A comprehensive report detailing all the work done in this project, including findings, methodology, and conclusions, is available in the directory. The report is titled [`report.pdf`](report.pdf) and provides deeper insights into the implementation and performance of the algorithms used.

## Conclusion

Please make sure to follow these setup instructions accurately to ensure that the notebooks run without any issues. Each notebook is self-contained and provides step-by-step guidance on applying Reinforcement Learning algorithms in the MiniGrid environment. Happy learning!
